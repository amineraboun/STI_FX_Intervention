<h1>Examples of Central Bank Interventions:<a class="headerlink" href="#examples-of-central-bank-interventions" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>Here are some examples of central bank interventions on the FX market, categorized by type of intervention, along with the circumstances leading to the intervention and the impact on the currency afterwards:</p>
<section id="sterilized-intervention">
<h2>1. Sterilized intervention:<a class="headerlink" href="#sterilized-intervention" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Example 1: Bank of Japan (BOJ) in 2011</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Circumstances: The BOJ intervened in the FX market to weaken the value of the Japanese yen, which had appreciated sharply in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. The strong yen was hurting Japan’s export-oriented economy by making Japanese goods more expensive for foreign buyers.</p></li>
<li><p>Intervention: The BOJ conducted sterilized intervention, in which it sold yen on the FX market and simultaneously bought US dollars. To offset the impact on the domestic money supply, the BOJ also conducted reverse repurchase operations, which drained liquidity from the money market.</p></li>
<li><p>Impact: The BOJ’s intervention was largely unsuccessful in the long term, as the yen continued to appreciate due to market forces.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Example 2: Bank of Korea (BOK) in 2018</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Circumstances: The BOK intervened in the FX market to prevent the Korean won from appreciating too much against the US dollar, which could hurt Korean exports and economic growth. The won had been appreciating due to expectations of higher interest rates in the US.</p></li>
<li><p>Intervention: The BOK conducted sterilized intervention, in which it sold won on the FX market and simultaneously bought US dollars. To offset the impact on the domestic money supply, the BOK issued short-term bonds and absorbed liquidity from the money market.</p></li>
<li><p>Impact: The BOK’s intervention was partially successful in stabilizing the won’s exchange rate, but there was also some volatility in the currency in the following months.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="unsterilized-intervention">
<h2>2. Unsterilized intervention:<a class="headerlink" href="#unsterilized-intervention" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Example 1: Swiss National Bank (SNB) in 2011</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Circumstances: The SNB intervened in the FX market to prevent the Swiss franc from appreciating too much against the euro, which could hurt Swiss exports and economic growth. The franc had been strengthening due to safe-haven demand in the aftermath of the eurozone debt crisis.</p></li>
<li><p>Intervention: The SNB conducted unsterilized intervention, in which it sold francs on the FX market and simultaneously bought euros. The SNB did not conduct offsetting transactions in the domestic money market, potentially affecting the money supply.</p></li>
<li><p>Impact: The SNB’s intervention was successful in the short term, but the central bank ultimately abandoned its currency peg against the euro in 2015, leading to a sharp appreciation in the franc.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Example 2: People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in 2019</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Circumstances: The PBOC intervened in the FX market to prevent the Chinese yuan from depreciating too much against the US dollar, which could lead to capital flight and other economic problems. The yuan had been under pressure due to US-China trade tensions and a slowing Chinese economy.</p></li>
<li><p>Intervention: The PBOC conducted unsterilized intervention, in which it sold US dollars and bought yuan on the FX market, potentially affecting the money supply.</p></li>
<li><p>Impact: The PBOC’s intervention was partially successful in stabilizing the yuan’s exchange rate, but there was also some volatility in the currency in the following months.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="fx-policy-intervention">
<h2>3. FX Policy intervention:<a class="headerlink" href="#fx-policy-intervention" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Example 1: European Central Bank (ECB) in 2012</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Circumstances: The ECB announced its Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program, which involved buying large amounts of government bonds to support struggling eurozone countries. The program was seen as a form of FX intervention and was used to stabilize the value of the euro and reduce volatility in the eurozone.</p></li>
<li><p>Intervention: The ECB conducted FX Policy intervention by announcing the OMT program, which signaled the central bank’s commitment to supporting the eurozone and stabilizing the euro’s exchange rate. The program was conditional on countries requesting a bailout from the European Stability Mechanism and implementing certain policy reforms.</p></li>
<li><p>Impact: The announcement of the OMT program was successful in calming financial markets and reducing the risk of a breakup of the eurozone. The euro’s exchange rate also stabilized after the announcement, and there was a decline in borrowing costs for struggling eurozone countries.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Example 2: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2013</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Circumstances: The RBI intervened in the FX market to support the value of the Indian rupee, which had been depreciating rapidly due to capital outflows and a current account deficit. The sharp depreciation of the rupee was causing inflation and other economic problems in India.</p></li>
<li><p>Intervention: The RBI conducted FX Policy intervention by announcing a series of measures to support the rupee, including tightening liquidity in the money market, imposing restrictions on gold imports, and raising short-term interest rates. The RBI also intervened in the FX market by selling US dollars.</p></li>
<li><p>Impact: The RBI’s intervention was successful in stabilizing the rupee’s exchange rate and reducing volatility in the currency. The measures also helped to reduce inflation and improve India’s external balance, although they also had some negative effects on the domestic economy.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Example 3: Bank of Russia in 2014</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Circumstances: The Bank of Russia intervened in the FX market to prevent a sharp depreciation of the Russian ruble, which had come under pressure due to falling oil prices and economic sanctions imposed by Western countries in response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine. The sharp depreciation of the ruble was causing inflation and other economic problems in Russia.</p></li>
<li><p>Intervention: The Bank of Russia conducted FX Policy intervention by announcing a series of measures to support the ruble, including raising interest rates, selling foreign currency reserves, and implementing currency controls. The central bank also intervened in the FX market by buying rubles and selling foreign currency.</p></li>
<li><p>Impact: The Bank of Russia’s intervention was partially successful in stabilizing the ruble’s exchange rate and reducing volatility in the currency. The measures helped to reduce inflation and improve Russia’s external balance, although they also had some negative effects on the domestic economy, including a recession.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Example 1: Bank of Japan (BOJ) in the 2008 Global Financial Crisis</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Circumstances: The 2008 Global Financial Crisis led to a sharp appreciation of the Japanese yen, which threatened to harm the country’s export-oriented economy.</p></li>
<li><p>Intervention: The BOJ conducted crisis management intervention by announcing a series of measures to support financial stability and ensure the smooth functioning of financial markets. The central bank also intervened in the FX market by selling yen and buying US dollars.</p></li>
<li><p>Impact: The BOJ’s intervention was partially successful in stabilizing the yen’s exchange rate and reducing volatility in the currency. The measures helped to support Japan’s economy during the crisis, although they also had some negative effects on the domestic economy, including inflation and a buildup of debt.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Example 2: Bank of England (BOE) in 1992</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Circumstances: In the early 1990s, the UK economy was in a recession, and the government was struggling with high inflation and a large current account deficit. To maintain the value of the pound sterling, the BOE joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in 1990, which aimed to keep exchange rates between European currencies within a narrow range. However, due to the recession and other factors, the UK’s economy was not strong enough to support the value of the pound within the ERM, leading to pressure on the BOE to devalue the currency. This pressure intensified in 1992, as currency speculators began to bet heavily against the pound, anticipating a devaluation.</p></li>
<li><p>Intervention: In an effort to maintain the value of the pound within the ERM, the BOE conducted a series of interventions in the FX market. These interventions involved buying large quantities of pounds and selling foreign currencies, such as the German mark and the US dollar. The BOE’s interventions were intended to create demand for pounds in the FX market, which would support the currency’s exchange rate and deter speculators from betting against it. However, these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, as speculators continued to sell pounds and push down the exchange rate.</p></li>
<li><p>Impact: The BOE’s intervention had a limited impact on the exchange rate of the pound, which continued to fall against other currencies. In September 1992, the BOE was forced to abandon its efforts to support the pound within the ERM and allow the currency to float freely on the FX market. The devaluation of the pound was seen as a major crisis for the UK economy, leading to a period of high inflation and a loss of confidence in the government’s economic policies. However, some analysts have argued that the devaluation ultimately helped to stimulate economic growth in the UK by making exports more competitive and attracting foreign investment.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These examples show that central bank interventions on the FX market can take various forms and have different outcomes. The effectiveness of an intervention depends on various factors, including the type of intervention, the circumstances that led to it, and the market participants reaction to the intervention.</p>
