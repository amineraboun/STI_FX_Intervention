*Many thanks to the Singapore Training Institute and in particular Alina Tan for the spotless organization!*

## Description
This five-day course aims to train participants, mostly from central banks, on
the theoretical and practical aspects of central bank interventions in foreign
exchange  markets.  The course  is  organized  by the  IMF-Singapore  Regional
Training Institute (STI) and taught by a team of IMF consultants.

The course includes a blend of lectures and workshops covering various topics:
  * Central banking theory on FX interventions
  * FX Interventions international practices
  * Time series econometrics and volatility modeling
  * Programming under Python

This  course also  presents the  model developped  by [Lafarguette  and Veyrune
(2011)](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2021/02/12/Foreign-Exchange-Intervention-Rules-for-Central-Banks-A-Risk-based-Framework-50081) on risk-based models for FX interventions. The course is accompanied by
a Python package, available on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/varfxi/)

Overall, the course aims to provide participants with a solid understanding of
the theoretical and practical aspects of central bank interventions in foreign
exchange  markets, along  with hands-on  experience  in using  Python and  IMF
software infrastructure for modeling conditional foreign exchange intervention
triggers. The main  takeaways for participants include  a deeper understanding
of     FX     interventions,      statistical     concepts,     and     Python
programming. Participants  can use this  knowledge to improve their  skills in
their respective roles and advance their careers in the field of finance.

## Materials

The materials of  the course consist in slides for  the lecture (links below),
as well as Python notebooks for practicising programming.

This website  contains all the materials  taught during the class,  as well as
extra resources for participants.

We designed a full-fledge Python package for modeling volatility for FX interventions, available on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/varfxi/)
