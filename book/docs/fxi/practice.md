** Mexico

Mexico has transitioned towards a free-float exchange rate after the devaluation of the peso 19th december 1994. At the time, the free-float regime was seen as temporary, but with time it gained substantial support and endured up to today.

### Funding FX reserves
One key aspect of the transition has been to accumulate FX reserves to be able to conduct FX interventions to mitigate FX volatility. 
* Mexico obtain USD remittances from the Federal Public Entities, especially PEMEX, the national oil company
* When the level of foreign reserves is deemed inadequate, the central bank has resorted to rules-based approaches to buy/sell US dollar from the market with preannounced auction mechanisms, where timing and prices were known in advance 
  * Buying USD via the **sale of US dollar put options** to the market via monthly auctions (1996-2001 and 2010-2011) with two requirements
  * The option strike price is the **fix exchange rate determined by the Bank of Mexico on the previous business day**
  * The option can only be executed only when the peso exchange rate of exercise **has appreciated with respect to its 20-day moving average** (meaning buying when USD is cheap)
  * When the level of foreign reserves was deemed too high due to sterilization costs: selling USD via **spot auctions** half of the amount accumulated during the previous quarter
  

### FX Sterilized interventions to smooth volatility
* Interventions on the spot market via rules-based auctions
  * **US dollar auctions with and without minimum bid price**
    * With minimum bid-price, decided on previous business day +2\% (bid are only eligible if they are above this price, yet it is a multiple price auction)
    * Without minimum bid-price and without triggering rule. The auctions are interactive, the participants know the bids during the auction and could improve their bid.
      
* Auctions of USD-denominated credit lines offered to banks, which they could on-lend to corporates (USD 3.2 billion in 2009)
  * *The resources came from the swap line with the Fed, not from the BAM reserves themselves*. The BAM still takes only the counterparty risk
  * Limit moral-hazard via an auction-based pricing mechanism, revealing true banks' risks ("*no free lunch*")

* Direct USD sales (discretionary) where the tendered amount and triggers are decided by the BAM FX commission
  * Including with institutions outside of the country (in 2017) 


### BAM Other FX Interventions Instruments

* **Foreign Exchange Hedge Auction Program via NDF Auctions Settled in MXN**
  * The BAM wants to sell foreign exchange hedges to participants, without endangering its own FX reserves
  * Market participants bid for the forward exchange rate they need at the maturity of the contract
    * At the end of contract: if the spot is higher than the assigned forward price (depreciation), the commercial bank makes a profit settled in pesos
    * All ND positions are rolled over unitl the BAM decides to stop them
    * Note that, even though the all transactions are settled in USD, the central bank is short USD. Which is a potential cost (settled in pesos)
    
* **Flexible credit line with the IMF to supplement current international reserves**
  *  Mexico was one of the first three countries to receive an IMF FCL in 2009 when the program was launched
  *  Initially around USD 47 bn, then USD 90 bn in 2016

### Mexico FX Interventions

* The BAM interventions framework has been considered by policymakers and the literature as efficient, and without FX target in mind
* Empirical evidence suggest that the central bank has been able to contain extreme volatility episodes
* Also helping to maintain the policy objective, which is to keep the interbank funding rate at the monetary policy objective

## Brazil

### Brazil during the GFC
* During the GFC, the Brazilian central bank used a combination of different instruments to stabilize the BRL
  * Swaps
  * Spot market auctions
  * Repo market auctions
  * Trade finance loans
  * Forward market auctions
  
* [Kohlscheen and Andrade (JIMF 2014)](https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeejimfin/v_3a47_3ay_3a2014_3ai_3ac_3ap_3a202-216.htm) find that the currency swaps carried in 2011 Q2-2012 had a significant effect on the BRL/USD


### Brazil (2013-2018)
* The BCB implemented the largest ever intervention in the FX derivatives market in August 2013
  * Initially to counter-act capital outflows and the BRL depreciation during the "Taper Tantrum"

* The open position of the BCB in these derivatives summed up to **7\% of the Brazilian GDP** (30\% of the international reserves) in the peak of the program in 2015
* The intervention program was considered successful and other EME have followed: Mexico (February 2017), Turkey (November 2017)

### Brazil 2013: Hedger-of-Last-Resort
* Due to historical restrictions to buy US dollars in the Brazilian sport market, the country's FX derivative markets became larger than the spot one. 
* Intervention program: daily sales of USD 500 million worth of currency non-deliverables forwards
  * USD forwards settled in BRL, also known as BCB swaps, developped by the BCB (the "swaps cambiais")
  * Traded in the local stock exchange ("B3")
