# Statistical Analysis with Python
In this section, we will provide examples of the implementation of some of the most commonly used and useful statistical tools in Python,
such as probability distributions, moment computations, loss functions (such as RMSE and MAE), OLS regression, and hypothesis testing.

We will delve deeper into each of these tools and provide detailed explanations and code examples to demonstrate their usage.  

## Bonus: Free statistics courses
