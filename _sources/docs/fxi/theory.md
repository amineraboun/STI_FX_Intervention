# Conceptual Framework

## Monetary Frameworks


`````{admonition} The Mundell Trilemma
:class: warning
The choice of the monetary framework and the goals of the central bank is constrained by the **Mundell Trilemma**, that states that countries can only achieve two out of the three objectives:
  * Independent monetary policy: for instance, determining the interest rate to achieve domestic objectives, such as controlling inflation 
  * Open capital account: capital flows can freely move in and out the country 
  * Fixed exchange rate: the local currency is pegged to an anchor, for instance, the US dollar or the 
`````

Most advanced economies have abandonned the fixed exchange rate objective after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, and are therefore pursuing independent monetary objectives (inflation targeting or, in the past, money-base targeting) under an open capital account.

Typically, countries trying to "round the corners of the trilemma", i.e. trying to achieve the three objectives simultaneously, will at a point face severe exchange rate/capital flows pressures if the fundamentals are not aligned. After burning their FX reserves to maintain a misaligned exchange rate level with open capital flows and independent monetary policy, countries will ultimately have to give up either open capital account or the peg. 

This situation occurred in South-East Asia at the end of the 1990s (the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis). At the time:
  * Most East-Asia countries in the 90s were *de facto* pegged to the USD 
  * Free mobility of capital (except in China)
  * Independent monetary policy with a high domestic interest rate to attract foreign investors
    * Countries were growing fast, foreign capital supplemented the lack of domestic savings
    * FX peg + high interest rate were generating a positive carry without FX risk for investors. Consequently, it fueled **hot money**
    * Huge credit boom: at the time, South-East Asia was receiving **half** of the world total capital flows to EM by the time 

These factors generated a **credit bubble** on over-leveraged economies, fueled by hot money

Hence, when the bubble bursted (first in Thailand), investors ran, triggering capital outflows and weakening currencies
  * Due to insufficient foreign reserves, countries were forced to devaluate, as FX interventions were not possible
  * The huge FX mismatch on banks and corporates balance sheets started a crisis, which was amplified by the interest rate hikes motivated to fight depreciation...

## Goals and Intermediate Objectives

`````{admonition} Definition: FX Interventions
:class: definition
Any official sale or purchase of foreign assets against domestic assets **in the foreign exchange market** (onshore or offshore)
`````
* FX Interventions are usually carried-out by the central bank, but can sometimes be under the responsibility of the Ministry of Finances, such as in Japan ([link](https://www.mof.go.jp/english/policy/international_policy/reference/feio/index.html))

Typically, the central banking literature distinguishes between goals and objectives:

`````{admonition} Central Bank Goal
:class: important
Ultimate purpose of the FX intervention. Should be consistent with the monetary framework of the central bank
````` 
*For instance, a FX intervention goal for the central bank could be about preserving financial stability*


`````{admonition} Intermediate Objectives
:class: important
How to reach the goals via the central bank's operational framework
````` 
*For instance, mitigating FX daily volatility via open-market interventions*


### Main Goals Motivating Interventions on the FX market

- **Price stability**
  - When large exchange rate movements pass-through inflation, generating temporary shocks

- **Financial stability**
        - Calm "disorderly market conditions" (see [link](https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/covid19-special-notes/en-special-series-on-covid-19-central-bank-support-for-foreign-exchange-markets.ashx)) for a discussion on how to assess disorderly market conditions)
        - Smooth capital flows and credit spillovers (impact on carry trade and excess returns)
        - Alleviate FX funding shortage
        - Reduce FX speculation

- **Terms of trade**
    - Support external competitiveness (especially during USD weakening phases)
    - Smooth commodity prices fluctuations

- **Building/managing FX reserves**
  - *In principle, without market impact*

- **Support fellow central banks in their exchange rate operations**

.. WARNING:: FXI should be consistent with the central bank's monetary framework
    FX interventions should not contradict the central bank mandate, else there is a risk of policy inconsistency (cf. the Mundell Trilemma) that would jeopardize monetary efficiency and central bank credibility
    
**Floating exchange rate regimes** (for instance, with inflation targeting) should use FX interventions for:
    * Financial Stability
      * For instance, when domestic agents face severe currency mismatch on their balance sheet, FX volatility is a financial stability threat
  * Preservation of the monetary objectives
    * For instance, when the pass-through of large - and temporary - exchange rate movements threaten the inflation target 
    
**Hard-peg and currency board** regimes typically intervene on the FX market to defend the peg, usually via FX windows, at a fixed exchange rate

**Crawling and soft-peg** conduct infrequent FX interventions when the exchange rate deviates outside of the central bank tolerance
  * However, there is a risk of a conflict between _de-jure_ and _de-facto monetary_ objectives


### FX Intermediate Objectives

The literature (see the BIS below) and international practices typically identify 5 main intermediate objectives:

* **Limit exchange rate volatility**
  * Even if the main goal of the central bank is to maintain price stability, limiting FX volatility is often important. FX volatility affects the price-setting behavior of firms: it causes average imported inflation to rise
  * Excessive FX volatility can also derail the transmission of monetary policy

* **Provide liquidity** to thin market

* **Smooth the path** of the exchange rate

* Limit FX pressure caused by international investors

* Influence the level of the exchange rate (if the main goal of the central bank is indeed an exchange rate nominal anchor)
