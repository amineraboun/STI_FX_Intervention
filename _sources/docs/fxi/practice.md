## Mexico

Mexico has transitioned towards a free-float exchange rate after the devaluation of the peso 19th december 1994. At the time, the free-float regime was seen as temporary, but with time it gained substantial support and endured up to today.

### Funding FX reserves
One key aspect of the transition has been to accumulate FX reserves to be able to conduct FX interventions to mitigate FX volatility. 
* Mexico obtain USD remittances from the Federal Public Entities, especially PEMEX, the national oil company
* When the level of foreign reserves is deemed inadequate, the central bank has resorted to rules-based approaches to buy/sell US dollar from the market with preannounced auction mechanisms, where timing and prices were known in advance 
  * Buying USD via the **sale of US dollar put options** to the market via monthly auctions (1996-2001 and 2010-2011) with two requirements
  * The option strike price is the **fix exchange rate determined by the Bank of Mexico on the previous business day**
  * The option can only be executed only when the peso exchange rate of exercise **has appreciated with respect to its 20-day moving average** (meaning buying when USD is cheap)
  * When the level of foreign reserves was deemed too high due to sterilization costs: selling USD via **spot auctions** half of the amount accumulated during the previous quarter
  

### FX Sterilized interventions to smooth volatility
* Interventions on the spot market via rules-based auctions
  * **US dollar auctions with and without minimum bid price**
    * With minimum bid-price, decided on previous business day +2\% (bid are only eligible if they are above this price, yet it is a multiple price auction)
    * Without minimum bid-price and without triggering rule. The auctions are interactive, the participants know the bids during the auction and could improve their bid.
      
* Auctions of USD-denominated credit lines offered to banks, which they could on-lend to corporates (USD 3.2 billion in 2009)
  * *The resources came from the swap line with the Fed, not from the BAM reserves themselves*. The BAM still takes only the counterparty risk
  * Limit moral-hazard via an auction-based pricing mechanism, revealing true banks' risks ("*no free lunch*")

* Direct USD sales (discretionary) where the tendered amount and triggers are decided by the BAM FX commission
  * Including with institutions outside of the country (in 2017) 


### BAM Other FX Interventions Instruments

* **Foreign Exchange Hedge Auction Program via NDF Auctions Settled in MXN**
  * The BAM wants to sell foreign exchange hedges to participants, without endangering its own FX reserves
  * Market participants bid for the forward exchange rate they need at the maturity of the contract
    * At the end of contract: if the spot is higher than the assigned forward price (depreciation), the commercial bank makes a profit settled in pesos
    * All ND positions are rolled over unitl the BAM decides to stop them
    * Note that, even though the all transactions are settled in USD, the central bank is short USD. Which is a potential cost (settled in pesos)
    
* **Flexible credit line with the IMF to supplement current international reserves**
  *  Mexico was one of the first three countries to receive an IMF FCL in 2009 when the program was launched
  *  Initially around USD 47 bn, then USD 90 bn in 2016

### Mexico FX Interventions

* The BAM interventions framework has been considered by policymakers and the literature as efficient, and without FX target in mind
* Empirical evidence suggest that the central bank has been able to contain extreme volatility episodes
* Also helping to maintain the policy objective, which is to keep the interbank funding rate at the monetary policy objective

## Brazil

### Brazil during the GFC
* During the GFC, the Brazilian central bank used a combination of different instruments to stabilize the BRL
  * Swaps
  * Spot market auctions
  * Repo market auctions
  * Trade finance loans
  * Forward market auctions
  
* [Kohlscheen and Andrade (JIMF 2014)](https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeejimfin/v_3a47_3ay_3a2014_3ai_3ac_3ap_3a202-216.htm) find that the currency swaps carried in 2011 Q2-2012 had a significant effect on the BRL/USD


### Brazil (2013-2018)
* The BCB implemented the largest ever intervention in the FX derivatives market in August 2013
  * Initially to counter-act capital outflows and the BRL depreciation during the "Taper Tantrum"

* The open position of the BCB in these derivatives summed up to **7\% of the Brazilian GDP** (30\% of the international reserves) in the peak of the program in 2015
* The intervention program was considered successful and other EME have followed: Mexico (February 2017), Turkey (November 2017)

### Brazil 2013: Hedger-of-Last-Resort
* Due to historical restrictions to buy US dollars in the Brazilian sport market, the country's FX derivative markets became larger than the spot one. 
* Intervention program: daily sales of USD 500 million worth of currency non-deliverables forwards
  * USD forwards settled in BRL, also known as BCB swaps, developped by the BCB (the "swaps cambiais")
  * Traded in the local stock exchange ("B3")

## Colombia

### Colombia Call and Put Options to Hedge Volatility Risk

* Objective: mitigate FX volatility, after the shift to a flexible exchange rate regime in 1998/99 (used to be crawling bands). *"Offer to the market hedges against extreme circumstances"*
* Offer **put** (protection against depreciation) and **call** (protection against appreciation) **options**
  * TRM: representative market Colombian peso/US dollar exchange rate
  * Strike prices: +5\% Higher (put) or -5\% lower (call) than the 20-day moving average of the TRM 
  * Threshold takes into account a low probability of activation, due to the +/- 5\% limit
  * Amount fixed at USD 180 million then USD 200 million

* Some discretion was applied: 
  * When the Colombian peso was weak, the central bank deactivate the put, because the central bank didn't want to buy USD at this price
  * Added some discretion when high demand (threshold, etc.)

### Put Options to Accumulate USD Reserves

* How to accumulate FX reserves at the best price and limiting market impact?
* Following Mexico's experience, the Colombian central bank auctioned these options at the end of each month (1999-2002 and 2003-2008) to banks, financial corporations and the MoF
* USD options with \textbf{one-month maturity} and a **strike price equal to the representative market Colombian peso/US dollar exchange rate (TRM)**
* Agents can only exercise the option when the TRM was below the 20-day average
  * The central bank could then avoid buying US dollar when the Colombian peso is weaker than the previous 20 days

* Suitable approach to accumulate FX reserves while minimizing market impact
* Through these auctions, the central bank bought USD 3.4 billion in 8 years
  * All 49 auctions were oversubscribed, with min/max amount of USD 30 million and USD 250 million

### Colombia Selling Reserves for Preserving Financial Stability

* Colombia is an inflation targeter operating a flexible exchange rate regime

* Foreign interventions should therefore be motivated by financial stability concerns

* The operating procedure depends on the type of financial stability threats:
  * If financial agents suffer from **closure in FX credit lines**: the central bank intervenes through \textbf{FX swaps} and acts as a liquidity provider
    * *FX swaps don't transfer FX risks*
  * If there is no private provision of FX hedge on the market, the central bank steps in and provide \textbf{USD non-deliverable forwards}
    * *FX forwards do transfer FX risk*
  * If the foreign reserves are enough, sell spot. If not, sell USD NDF (settled in local currencies)

## Peru

### Peru Monetary Framework

* *De jure*, the BCRP (the Peruvian central bank) operates an inflation targeting regime with a floating exchange rate arrangement
  * The inflation target is fixed at 2\% with a +/- band of 1\%
  
* Yet, because of multiple FX interventions, the IMF has been reclassifying temporarily the exchange rate to crawl-like (with back in forth in 2020 and 2021)

* In effect, the BCRP conducts **very frequent foreign exchange interventions**, as noted in [BCRP study 2019](https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap104q.pdf) and [BCRP study 2018](https://www.elibrary.imf.org/downloadpdf/book/9781484375686/ch012.pdf) with frequency of interventions between 50 and 188 days (out of 250 business days) depending on the year !

* The main reason is because Peru used to be an \textbf{heavily dollarized economy} and FX volatility creates substantial financial stability risks !

### Peru Assessing FXI Efficiency

* Because of financial dollarization, the main objective of FX interventions is to prevent FX volatility

* Look at the volatility of the currencies of other countries in the region as a benchmark

* Indeed, Peru did pretty well in mitigating volatility compared to average volatility of LATAM currencies

* It comes at **a cost though**: frequent central bank FX interventions don't provide incentives for the development of the derivatives market in Peru
  * ... forcing the central bank to intervene more often to dampen volatility
  
* This is why the central bank decided to design \textbf{structural policies} to alleviate the financial dollarization problem

## Thailand

### Thailand BOT FXI Objectives

* According to the [BOT-BIS article](https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap104x.pdf), the objectives of the BOT are:
  * Curtail excessive and persistent volatility
  * Discourage speculation
  * Deter sharp capital flows
  * Not intended to influence the exchange rate level, nor gaining competitiveness

### BOT FXI Implementation

* Uses both verbal and actual interventions

* Discretionary timing based on "market developments and market conditions" (volatility, liquidity, etc.)
  * Looking not only at the spot against USD but also the NEER, the REER and other regional currencies

* Conducted mainly via USD/THB spot on both onshore and offshore markets

* The BOT employs a designated agent to maintain anonymity in the market
  * Cancel the signaling effect 
  * Yet the BoT is highly credible, with more than USD 225 bn FX reserves in 2023


### BOT Sterilization

* Main instruments: BOT bills and bonds (54%)
  * Main instrument, supporting market development and curve pricing
  * 14-day to three-year maturity
  * Separate segments with the Ministry of Finance to avoid arbitrages

* Bilateral repurchase operations and deposit faciliy (30%)

* FX swaps (16%)
  * Absorb THB while injecting USD in up to one-years tenors
  * Mostly used to alleviate USD funding costs in Thailand



BOT: Total Absorption Instruments Outstanding

*Source: Bank of Thailand (2018)*


### BOT Communication


* The BOT doesn't announce interventions ex-ante nor ex-post

* Consistent with the market anonymity it is looking for

* Yet, it publishes its level of foreign reserves weekly with one-week lag
  * Direct comunications regarding the effect of FX policy and market operations are also addressed to key influencers - researchers, private analysts and members of the press -
    * who in turn will make their own communication to the general public
